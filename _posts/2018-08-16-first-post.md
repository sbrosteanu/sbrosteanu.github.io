title: Beginning of a (hopefully awesome) journey.

Aaaand, I actually created a kinda-sorta personal-ish website.

Right. Let me introduce myself.  
My name is Stefan Brosteanu and I am an Android developer.  
I've started this site/blog as a way to channel the need to tell other people the interesting things that I come across in my career.  
I hope that, at least some of the articles I will share here are/will be of use to someone/somewhere.

See you soon, with my first *real* post,  
Stefan
