title: About me
---

I've been developing with passion for the Android platform for over 4 years now, although during this time, I've also dabbled a bit with the Apple-y side of things.

During my career, I was fortunate enough to work on a variety of mobile application solutions, and for a variety of clients, ranging from travel giants to a daring startups looking to put a dent in the social networking space.

Avid tinkerer and tech enthusiast, in my spare time, I love learning new things, experimenting, and if or when my laptop's closed and the chores around the house are done, I'm either reading, meditating or playing video games.
